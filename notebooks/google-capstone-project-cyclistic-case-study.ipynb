For this case study, I will be using data from November 2020 through October 2021.\n\nTo increase the company's profits, Cyclistic's marketing director has asked how we can increase annual membership riders by converting casual riders or those who don't purchase annual memberships. In order to answer this business task, we need to provide the marketing director with data insights between casual and membership riders so the marketing team can effectively apply their marketing strategy and better target their advertisements.\n\nSome questions that might help the marketing team better understand the data are:\n1. How much are each user using the bike on a given day of the week and month?\n2. How long is each user's average trip duration on a daily and monthly basis?\n3. What kind of bike is each user using and is there a difference between daily and monthly usage for bike types?\n4.

Although starting with clean and complete data would have been preferable, Motivate's data has nevertheless provided answers to our questions we have inquired to which we can provide key insights to Cyclistic's marketing director and her team so they can execute an effective marketing strategy to convert casual riders into membership riders.\n\n<a id = \"sub-section-four-one\"></a>\n#### Key Insights\n\n* Membership riders account for more rides overall. However, casual riders account for more rides on the weekend while both casual and membership riders ride more often from the months of March through October, which might be attributed to more favorable weather conditions as opposed to the winter months.\n\n* Casual riders ride for a longer duration than membership riders on average by twofold. Casual riders are also more likely on average to ride for a longer period than membership riders throughout the week and year.\n\n* The most popular bike among all groups is the classic bike. Classic bikes are really popular with the casual group during the weekend.\n\n* Popular stations among both groups are:\n    1. Streeter Dr & Grand Ave\n    2. Michigan Ave & Oak St\n    3. Wells St & Concord Ln\n    4. Millennium Park\n    5. Clark St & Elm St\n\n\n* Popular stations among casual riders are:\n\n    1. Streeter Dr & Grand Ave\n    2. Millenium Park\n    3. Michigan Ave & Oak St\n    4. Theater on the Lake\n    5. Shedd Aquarium\n\n\n* Popular stations among membership riders are:\n\n    1. Clark St & Elm St\n    2. Wells St & Concord Ln\n    3. Kingsbury St & Kinzie St\n    4. Wells St & Elm St\n    5. Dearborn St & Erie St\n    \n<a id = \"sub-section-four-two\"></a>\n#### Recommendations\n\n* Since most riders are more active during the spring and summer months, target advertisements against casual riders to try to convert them into membership riders during the off-peak months by offering a membership price discount.\n\n* Target advertisements against casual riders at their popular bike stations and other points of interest in the surrounding area.\n\n* Seek partnerships in the surrounding area or points of interest for membership discounts or benefits that would attract casual riders into getting a membership.\n","metadata":{}}]}
